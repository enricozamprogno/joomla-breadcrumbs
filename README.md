Krizalys Breadcrumbs
====================

[Krizalys Breadcrumbs][krizalys-breadcrumbs] is a module for [Joomla!][joomla]
which provides breadcrumbs functionality similar to the built-in Breadcrumbs
module, with more customization options. Additionally, it makes use of [rich
snippets][rich-snippets]. This helps search engines such as [Google][google] to
better understand the structure of your website and leads to better SEO.

Using this module allows conforming search engines to offer comprehensive
breadcrumbs of your pages, directly from their search results page. For example,
a [Google search for Stephen King][google-search-example] returns a result from
[Amazon][amazon], with the full breadcrumbs from the root of their website:

![Google search for Stephen King](http://demo.krizalys.com/joomla/images/rich-breadcrumbs.png)

The module supports Joomla! 3, and Microdata and RDFa formats. Webmasters can
also choose to generate only XHTML markup, allowing their website to remain
XHTML compliant. To make yourself a better idea of the module, please check our
[live demo][krizalys-breadcrumbs-demo] and for more information, please consult
the [documentation][documentation].

The extension is licensed under the [3-Clause BSD License][bsd-3-clause].
